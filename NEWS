0.2.0
=====
- The plugin now supports a variety of archive managers through a generic
  interface, that requires the archive manager to install a .desktop file
  as usual, that lists the supported mime types, and a .tap file that acts
  as a wrapper script to invoke the archive manager with the appropriate
  parameters for the create, extract-here and extract-to actions.
- Wrapper scripts for file-roller (the GNOME archive manager) and ark (the
  KDE archive manager) have been added. Xarchiver, the Xfce archive manager,
  will include an appropriate xarchiver.tap file in the next release.
- Import the file-roller icons for the create and extract actions.

- Updated translations: Benedikt Meurer (de), Szervác Attila (hu)

0.1.2
=====
- When extracting an archive into the current folder, or creating an archive in
  the current folder, the file manager view is reloaded properly now once the
  file-roller command terminates, no matter if Thunar was build with or without
  FAM/Gamin.
- New translations: Stavros Giannouris (el), Stephane Roy (fr), Szervác
  Attila (hu), Daichi Kawahata (ja), Piotr Malinski (pl), Andrey Fedoseev (ru),

0.1.0

  extracting archives using File Roller.
